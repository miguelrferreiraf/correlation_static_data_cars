Hey, folks!

What about some basic data science? In this small simple projects I demonstrate one of the basic concepts of data science, the correlation coefficient or Pearson correlation.

There are also some important line codes involving data cleaning that I think is very very important. Don't ignore it.

Concepts approached by this code includes:

### Distribution

Basic concept involving the amount of data from a specific feature for another specific feature:

```
#distribution plot
sns.FacetGrid(data,height=5).map(sns.histplot,"height").add_legend()
```

### Distribution through boxplot

### Multivariate analysis

Consists in a analysis of several correlations; usually we define by multivariate when it's made with more than two variables.

### Correlation coefficient

Finnaly, the correlation coefficient allow us to plot all correlation among all features.
