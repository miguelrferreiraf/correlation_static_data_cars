Hey, folks!

What about some basic data science? In this small simple projects I demonstrate one of the basic concepts of data science, the correlation coefficient or Pearson correlation.

Go to [code](https://github.com/miguelrferreiraf/correlation_static_data_cars/blob/main/analysing_static_data_cars_CODIGO_FINALIZADO.ipynb)

There are also some important line codes involving data cleaning that I think is very very important. Don't ignore it.

Concepts approached by this code includes:

### Distribution

Basic concept involving the amount of data from a specific feature for another specific feature:

```
#distribution plot
sns.FacetGrid(data,height=5).map(sns.histplot,"height").add_legend()
```

### Distribution through boxplot

### Multivariate analysis

One of my visually favorites atributtes is the 3x3 multivariate plotting of feature correlations. 

Consists in a analysis of several correlations; usually we define by multivariate when it's made with more than two variables.

### Correlation coefficient

Finnaly, the correlation coefficient allow us to plot all correlation among all features. 

Beyond this, we begin into linear regression models for optmization and label prediction of data strings content.
